What are Operators in

Opearators are symbols or keywords that tell the Javascript engine to perform some sort of actions.
For example, the addition (+) symbol is an operator that tells Javascript engine to add two variables or values,
while the equal-to (==), greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols are the operators that tells Javascript
engine to compare two variables or values, and so on.

The arithmetic operators are used to perform common arithmetical operation, such as addition, multiplication e.t.c
Here is a complete list of Javascript's arithmetic operators:

Operator           Description    Example  
+ Addition          x + y         Sum of x and y
- Subtraction       x - y         Difference of x and y
* Multiplication    x * y         Product of x and y
/ Division          x / y         Quotient of x and y
% Modulus           x % y         Remainder of x divided by y


Augmented Assignment Operators

Operator     Description                  Example       Is the same as
=             Assign                       x = y          x = y
+=            Add and assign               x += y         x = x + y
-=            Subtract and assign          x -= y         x = x - y
*=            Multiply and Assign          x *= y         x = x * y
/=            Divide and assign Quotient   x /= y         x = x / y
%=            Divide and assign Modulus    x %= y         x = x % y


Javascript Increament and Decreament Operators
The increament/decreament operators are used to Increament/Decreament variable's values.

Operator    Name              Effects 
++x         Pre-increament     Increaments x by one, than returns x
x++         Post-increament    Returns x, then increaments x by one 
--x         Pre-decreament     Decreaments x by one, then returns x
x--         Post-decreament    Returns x, then decreament x by one.



Javascript Logical Operator
The Logical operators are typically used to combine conditional statements.

Operators  Name    Example Result
&& And     x && y   True if both x and y are true 
|| or      x || y   True if either x or y is true
  Not      |x       True if x is not true

 Javascript Compared Operators
 The comparison operators are used to compare two values in a Boolean fashion.

 Opearators                     Name      Example Result
 == Equal                       x == y     True if x is equal to y  
 === Identical                  x === y    True if x is equal to y, and they are of the same type 
 |= Not equal                   x |= y     True if x is not equal to y 
 |== Not Identical              x |== y    True if x is not equal to y, or they are not of the same type
 < Less than                    x < y      True if x is less than y
 > Greater than                 x > y      True if x is greater than y
 >= Greater than ior equal to   x >= y     True if x is less than or equal to y
 = Less than or equal to        x <= y     True if x is less than or equal to y.
