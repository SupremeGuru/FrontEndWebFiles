case sensitity in js
js is case-sensitive. this means that variables, language keywords , function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters

for example the variable myVar must be typed myVar not MyVar or myvar.
Similarly, the method name getElementById() must be typed with the exact case not as getElementByID()
