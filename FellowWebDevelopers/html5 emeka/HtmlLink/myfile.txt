* The men who are great live with that which is substantial, they do not stay with what is showy,
the one they discard , the other they hold - Lao Tzu
* The beginning of transformation is the increase of perception, as you see more, you can
materialize more. and once you know better, you can achieve bigger. The great women and men of this world,
the one responsible for the magical symphonies, the beautiful movements, the advancements of science and
progress of technology; started by reengineering their thinking and reinventing their awareness. In so
doing, they entered a secret universe that the majority could not perceive. And this in turn allowed them to
make the daily choices that few choose to make. Which automatically, delivered the daily results that few 
get to experience.
