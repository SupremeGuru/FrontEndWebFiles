Data Types in js
Data types basically specity what kind of data can be stored and mainpulated within a program.

there are six basic data types in js which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. string, number and boolean are primitive data types. object, array and function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.
