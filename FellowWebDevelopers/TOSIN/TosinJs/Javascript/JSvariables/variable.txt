Variables are fundamental to all programming languages.
Variables are used to store data, like string of text, numbers, e.t.c.
The data or value stored in the variables can be set, updated, and retrieved whenever needed. 
In general, variables are symbolic names for values.

U can create a variable with the var keyword, whereas the assignment operator(=) is used to assign values 
to variables,like this:

var variableName = value;

let age = 12
const salary ;
salary = 123456.
