Understanding the JS syntax

The syntax of JS is the set of rules that defines a correctly structured JS program.

A JS consists of javascript statements that are placed within the 
<script></script> HTML tags in a web page, or within the external JAVASCRIPT file having .js extension.

Case Sensitivity in JS

JS is case-sensitive. This means that variables, languages, function names, and other identifiers
must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

For example, the variable myVar must be typed myVar not MyVar or myvar.
Similarly, the method name getElementById() must be typed with the exact case not as getElementByID().
