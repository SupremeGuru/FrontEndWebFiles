Data types in Javascript
Data types basically specify what kind of data cn be stored and manipulated within a program.

There are six basic data types in Javascript which can be divided intro three main categories: Primitive (or primary),
composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.
Objects, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are
special data types.

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collection of values
and more complex entities.
