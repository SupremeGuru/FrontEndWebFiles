JSON is based on two basic structures:

Object: This is defined as an unordered collection of key/value pairs(i.e. key:value).Each object 
begins with a aleft curly bracket{and ends with a right curly bracket}. Multiple key/value pairs are 
seperated by a comma, .

[and ends with a right bracket]. Values are seperated by a comma, .

In JSON, property names or keys are always strings, while the value numbers, true or false, null or even object.
