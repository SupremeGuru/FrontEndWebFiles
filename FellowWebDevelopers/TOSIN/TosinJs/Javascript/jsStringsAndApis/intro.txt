What is String in JavaScript??

A string is a sequence of letters, numbers, special characters and  arithemetic values or combination of all. 
Strings can be created by enclosing the string literal (i.e string characters) either within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

let userName = "App123 ! le"
let emoji = '&#128516;'
let password = 'abcd1234'
let receiptNum = '324423'
let userAccount = '09322222309'

JavaScript Escape Sequences

Escape Sequences are also useful for situations where you want to use characters that have special meanings in JavaScript. 
For example, if you wanted to include a quote within a
string that contains quotes, or an opening bracket within a string that contains brackets,
you could use the escape sequence \ before those characters. Here’s how:
\t – Tab
\n – New line
\’ – Single quote
\" – Double Quote
